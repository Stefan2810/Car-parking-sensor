#Car Parking Sensor with ESP8266
Overview
This project implements a smart car parking sensor system using an ESP8266 microcontroller. The system is designed to detect the presence of a vehicle in a parking space and communicate this information to a central server or a mobile application via Wi-Fi.

#Features
Vehicle Detection: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of a vehicle in a parking space.
Real-time Monitoring: Provides real-time status updates regarding parking space occupancy.
Web Interface: Offers a web-based interface for visualizing parking space availability and managing sensor settings.
Configurable Alerts: Sends alerts to designated endpoints (e.g., mobile devices or servers) when parking space occupancy changes.
Low-cost Solution: Built using affordable components, making it accessible for DIY enthusiasts and small-scale deployments.

#Components
ESP8266 Microcontroller: Controls the sensor operation and manages communication with the network.
Ultrasonic Sensors: Detect the presence of vehicles by measuring the distance between the sensor and the vehicle.
Wi-Fi Module: Enables wireless communication between the sensor system and external devices.
Power Supply: Provides the necessary power to operate the system, with options for battery or mains power.

#Usage
Access the web interface hosted by the ESP8266 to monitor parking space availability.
Receive real-time alerts on your mobile device or server whenever parking space occupancy changes.
Customize the system settings via the web interface to suit specific requirements.
Integrate the sensor data with other smart city applications or IoT platforms for broader utility.
